Workspace: Collecting workspace information# QuizMaster Project

## Overview
QuizMaster is a web-based application designed to manage quizzes, chapters, and subjects. It includes both a **frontend** built with Vue.js and a **backend** powered by Flask. The application supports user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and CRUD operations for various entities like users, subjects, chapters, quizzes, and questions.

---

## Frontend

### Framework and Tools
- **Vue.js**: The frontend is built using Vue 3.
- **Vite**: Used for fast development and build processes.
- **FontAwesome**: Provides icons for the UI.

### Directory Structure
- **`index.html`**: The entry point for the frontend.
- **`src/`**: Contains the main application code.
  - **`App.vue`**: The root Vue component.
  - **`main.js`**: Initializes the Vue app and sets up routing.
  - **`router/`**: Contains route definitions for navigation.
  - **`views/`**: Includes all the main pages like admindash.vue, editsub.vue, addchap.vue, etc.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable Vue components.

- **Flask-Limiter**: Implements rate limiting.
- **SQLite**: The database used for storing application data.

### Directory Structure
- **`app.py`**: The main backend application file.
- **instance**: Contains the SQLite database file (`db.sqlite3`).

### Features
- **Authentication**:
  - User login and signup.
  - Admin login with role-based access control.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Manage users, subjects, chapters, quizzes, and questions.
- **Statistics**:
  - Fetch user performance and subject statistics.
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Protects endpoints from abuse (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
- **Protected Routes**:
  - Secured with JWT tokens.
- **Search**:
  - Search functionality for users, subjects, quizzes, and questions.

### API Endpoints
- **Authentication**:
  - `/login`: User login.
  - `/signup`: User signup.
  - `/adminlogin`: Admin login.
- **Subjects**:
  - `/createsubject`: Create a new subject.
  - `/editsubject/<subject_id>`: Edit an existing subject.
  - `/deletesubject/<subject_id>`: Delete a subject.
  - `/getsubjects`: Fetch all subjects.
- **Chapters**:
  - `/createchapter/<subject_id>`: Create a chapter under a subject.
  - `/editchapter/<chapter_id>`: Edit a chapter.
  - `/deletechapter/<chapter_id>`: Delete a chapter.
  - `/getchapter/<subject_id>`: Fetch chapters for a subject.
- **Quizzes**:
  - `/createquiz/<chapter_id>`: Create a quiz under a chapter.
  - `/editquiz/<quiz_id>`: Edit a quiz.
  - `/deletequiz/<quiz_id>`: Delete a quiz.
  - `/getquiz/<chapter_id>`: Fetch quizzes for a chapter.
- **Questions**:
  - `/createquestion/<quiz_id>`: Add a question to a quiz.
  - `/editquestion/<question_id>`: Edit a question.
  - `/deletequestion/<question_id>`: Delete a question.
  - `/getquestion/<quiz_id>`: Fetch questions for a quiz.
- **Statistics**:
  - `/getcounts`: Fetch counts of users, subjects, chapters, and quizzes.
  - `/subjectstats`: Fetch statistics for subjects.

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
3. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Notes
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- Ensure the backend is running before using the frontend.
- Use `http://localhost:5173` as the frontend origin for CORS configuration.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Modularize the backend by moving models to a separate `models.py` file.
- Add more detailed logging and error handling.
- Implement unit tests for both frontend and backend.

GitHub Copilot: # QuizMaster Project

## Overview
QuizMaster is a web-based application designed to manage quizzes, chapters, and subjects. It includes both a **frontend** built with Vue.js and a **backend** powered by Flask. The backend uses **SQLite** as the database and supports both **raw SQL** and **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database operations.

---

## Backend Details

### Database: SQLite
- **SQLite** is a lightweight, serverless RDBMS used for this project.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to set up and use.
  - Ideal for small to medium-sized applications.
  - No need for a separate database server.
- **Limitations**:
  - Not suitable for high-concurrency applications.
  - Limited support for advanced features like stored procedures.

### SQL Usage
The backend uses a combination of **raw SQL** and **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database interactions.

#### SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** allows us to interact with the database using Python objects.
- Example:
  ```python
  user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()
  db.session.add(new_user)
  db.session.commit()
  ```
- **Advantages**:
  - Simplifies database operations.
  - Reduces the need to write raw SQL queries.
  - Automatically handles relationships and cascading deletes.

#### Raw SQL
- **Raw SQL** is used for complex queries or when fine-grained control is needed.
- Example:
  ```python
  sql = text("SELECT * FROM chapter WHERE subject_id = :subject_id")
  chapters = db.session.execute(sql, {"subject_id": subject_id}).fetchall()
  ```
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides flexibility for custom queries.
  - Useful for performance optimization.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires manual handling of SQL syntax and parameters.
  - More prone to SQL injection if not handled carefully.

### Key Features of the Backend
1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication for secure access.
   - Admin and user roles with role-based access control (RBAC).

2. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations for users, subjects, chapters, quizzes, and questions.
   - Example:
     - ORM: `User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()`
     - Raw SQL: `db.session.execute(text("DELETE FROM user WHERE id = :user_id"), {"user_id": user_id})`

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Protects endpoints from abuse using `Flask-Limiter`.

4. **Statistics**:
   - Fetch user performance and subject statistics using raw SQL for aggregation.

5. **Relationships**:
   - **One-to-Many**: Subjects to Chapters, Chapters to Quizzes.
   - **Many-to-Many**: Users to Subjects (via `UserSubject`).

---

## Summary of SQL Usage
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Used for standard CRUD operations and relationships.
- **Raw SQL**: Used for:
  - Complex queries (e.g., joins, aggregations).
  - Performance-critical operations.
  - Custom search functionality.

By combining ORM and raw SQL, the backend achieves both simplicity and flexibility, making it robust and efficient for managing the QuizMaster application.
